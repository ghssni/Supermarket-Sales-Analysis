- Generate actionable insights and strategic recommendations to boost sales and optimize profit margins in Q2.

## Tools and Technologies
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Tableau

## File Description
- `Supermarket_Sales_Analysis.ipynb` : Jupyter Notebook containing the code used for data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and visualization.
- `Supermarket_Sales_Data.csv` : CSV file containing the Supermarket sales data.

## Exploratory Data Analysis Recap
We'll conduct in-depth analysis to understand customer behavior, product performance, and sales trends.
The analysis and visualization of the Supermarket sales data revealed several key insights, as follows :
- January has Highest sales in Q1, indicating a strong start in Q1
- Total sales decrease during the end of the month
- Most profitable product category
- We have the most sales at 7:00 PM and 1:00 PM
- Our best selling product line in Q1 is Electronic Accessories

By understanding each branch's customer behaviour and matching promotions for them, we can boost sales in upcoming Q2.

## Suggestion
Based on the results of the analysis, strategic recommendations to increase total sales in Q2 include:
- Strengthen marketing strategy for Electronic Accessories categories that are in demand.
- Improve stock management and product arrangement to match customer preferences in each branch.
- Optimize marketing and promotion strategies to increase the number of transactions and customer loyalty, especially among Normal customers.
- Strengthen membership program by offering greater added value to customers to drive more transactions and increase retention.
